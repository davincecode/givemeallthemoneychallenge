# Developer Challenge 1 with Create React App

The goal is to replicate the image shown on the Challenge.

## In this project:

- The orange bar increases if a number of users send a donation.
- The amount on the top notification box is the remaining amount to reach the $500 goal.
- It would show the total number of people who sent donations until it reaches the max goal.
- The amount on the input should reflect the amount below that shows the total amount of donation that will be sent.

Added functionality:
- The button should be disabled if the bar is at 100% or $500.
- The button should be disabled if the bar is at 0% or $0.
